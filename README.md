### What I learned

This project was similar to the one I did before, and I used it as a chance to sharpen my CSS Grid skills even more. Along the way, I also picked up a couple of neat tricks.

1. Grid layout with `grid-template-areas`:
I used `grid-template-areas` again to set up the layout. This time, I had to tweak the column sizes a bit to get the spacing just right. Playing with the `grid-template-columns` helped me balance how much space each section takes up.

2. Profile pictures with a "fake" border:
The profile pictures had a border (or stroke), but it wasnâ€™t part of the actual image. I couldâ€™ve used `box-sizing: content-box;`, but instead, I went with a little trick: I added a `box-shadow` that mimics a border. It doesnâ€™t mess with the box model and still gives the same look. ðŸ˜„

**Hereâ€™s a code snippet showing both things in action:**
```html
<header class="feature__header">
    <img class="feature__header--img feature__header--stroke-daniel" src="/images/image-daniel.jpg"       alt="Profile picture of Daniel">
    <h3>Daniel Clifford</h3>
    <h4>Verified Graduate</h4>
</header>
```
```scss
.feature__header {
    display: grid;
    gap: 0.25rem 1.0625rem;
    grid-template-areas: 
    "left right1"
    "left right2";
    grid-template-columns: auto 1fr;

    &--img {
        width: 28px;
        height: 28px;
        border-radius: 100%;

        grid-area: left;
    }
    &--stroke-patrick {
        box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px 2px $color-8;
        -webkit-box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px 2px $color-8;
        -moz-box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px 2px $color-8;
    }
    &--stroke-daniel {
        box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px 2px $color-9;
        -webkit-box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px 2px $color-9;
        -moz-box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px 2px $color-9;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

I feel like really getting the hang of Grid will pay off in the long run. I donâ€™t want to go too deep down the rabbit hole since Iâ€™m I want to start learning React soon, but Iâ€™ll definitely focus on Grid for a few more projects to solidify the basics.

Another thing Iâ€™ve noticed is that Iâ€™m becoming more aware of what my changes actually affectâ€”whether itâ€™s styling, logic, setup, or visuals in the browser. This awareness helps me stay on top of the project and know exactly where I am in the process. Itâ€™s also made my commit messages way more useful and organized. Iâ€™ve started using proper labels like `style:`, `chore:`, `fix:`, `feat:`, `refactor:`, and `docs:` more consistently, and Iâ€™ll keep working on that as well.
